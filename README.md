Because some ISPs still don't get IPv6 right and some ISPs began making NAT worse (CGNAT without open ports) I was in need of a relay server that connected IPv4-only clients with IPv6-only servers.
Because understanding documentation for existing solutions is not easy I quickly found someone who shared their code in a familiar language.
